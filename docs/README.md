# Q&A
## I have imported wrong files and cannot get rid of them:
Delete the following folders to reset cozy (this will loose all saved progress):
```
~/.local/share/cozy
~/.cache/cozy
```

## I can't uninstall the Flatpak:

Try
```
flatpak uninstall com.github.geigi.cozy/x86_64/stable
```
or
```
flatpak uninstall --user com.github.geigi.cozy/x86_64/stable
```
